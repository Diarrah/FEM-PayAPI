# Frontend Mentor - PayAPI multi-page website

![Design preview for the PayAPI multi-page website coding challenge](./public/preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for purchasing this premium Frontend Mentor coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow. These premium challenges are perfect portfolio pieces, so please do feel free to use what you build in your portfolio to show others.

**To do this challenge, you need a solid understanding of HTML and CSS and a basic understanding of JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The download includes mobile, tablet & desktop designs for a Homepage, About page, Pricing page and Contact page. A design system is also included to provide colors, fonts, etc.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the Sketch design file provided. You can download the design file on the platform. It comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up on Sketch or other popular design tools like Figma and Adobe XD.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT** ‚ö†Ô∏è: If you're going to import this design into Figma or Adobe XD to work with, there are a few rendering issues that you should be aware of:

- When you import it to Figma, it will say a couple of fonts are missing. To resolve this, just select Public Sans from the dropdown menu and select `italic` for the first one and `medium` for the second one.
- In Figma, the SVG for the "Easy to implement" section on the homepage doesn't render correctly for mobile and tablet. The correct looking asset is exported and in the `/assets` folder though.
- In XD, some of the logos are rendering incorrectly. Also, on the desktop about page design, the company stats and the headings that run down the left side aren't aligned properly.

These are just a few points to be aware of if you're using either of these tools to view the design.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images can be re-used at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the Sketch file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/). **IMPORTANT: There are already a couple of `.gitignore` files in this project. Please do not remove them or change the content of the files. This is to avoid the accidental upload of the Sketch file to GitHub. With these premium challenges, please be sure not to share the Sketch file in your GitHub repo. Thanks!**
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel). We've got more information about deploying your project with Vercel below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
7. If you'd like to try making your project fully responsive, we'd recommend checking out [Sizzy](https://bit.ly/fm-sizzy). It's a great browser that makes it easy to view your site across multiple devices.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use Vercel, here are some steps to follow to get started:

1. [Sign up to Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel-signup) and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) integration.
2. Connect your project to Vercel from the ["Import project" page](https://vercel.com/import), using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
3. Once connected, every time you `git push`, Vercel will create a new [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and the deployment URL will be shown on your [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Submit it on the platform so that other users will see your solution on the site. Here's our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) to help you do that. **With these premium challenges please be sure not to upload the Sketch file to GitHub when you're submitting to the platform and sharing it around.**
2. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
3. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor** including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.

## Giving feedback
